# Market capitalization and circulating supply

### Market cap
* Market cap = quantity of coins currently in circulation * price of each coin
* Similar to how stocks work, where a company's market cap is the price of their stock * how many shares are currently in existence. 
	* The difference in crypto is that you aren't really buying a portion of a company when you buy a token.

### Circulating supply
* The amount of tokens currently in circulation. 
* Different crypto projects use different distribution models
	* Proof of work (e.g., Bitcoin), proof of stake (e.g., Cardano)

### Max supply
* The maximum amount of tokens that can ever be put into circulation. 
* Some projects, like Ethereum (or the USD) do not have a max supply. An infinite supply of tokens can be put into circulation. 

### Fully diluted market cap
* What the project would look like if all the coins were in circulation, assuming the current price was fixed. 

### Some examples
* **XRP**
	* All of their coins are already in existence.
	* If you look at the circulating supply or XRP, you'll notice that the circulating supply of XRP is 46.72B with the max supply being 100B (~47% in circulation).
	* However, the remaining 53% of tokens were burned to give an illusion as to how much XRP there actually is. 
	* When you burn half the tokens, you're essentially doubling the cost of entry to later investors, giving early investors a capitalistic advantage over them.
	* This can be contrasted with BTC, where there is no centralized ownership and no private crowd sale prior to the token's launch. 
		* Currently, there are ~18.8M BTC in existence and the rest have to be mined. 
		* All BTC in circulation had to be mined at some point.

* **NEO**
	* Neo is a proof of stake coin, meaning that holding it can earn you more of this crypto. 
	* Currently, there's only 70.5M Neo in existence with the max supply being 100M.
	*  The remaining 29% are to be earned by staking it. 
		* A distinction is to be made here between NEO and XRP. This remaining 29% can actually enter circulation, as opposed to the 53% of burned XRP that will never be recovered.

* **GRT**
	* The graph's issuance is done progressively, with 47% currently in circulation. 
	* The fully diluted market cap at the current price is $6.9B.
		* Recall that Market cap = circulating supply * token price.
	* However, if the remaining 53% of the max supply is dumped on the market today, we would not reach the 6.9B market cap. 
	* Instead, we'd see the price of the GRT token divide by ~2, because we've increase the supply without increasing the demand.
